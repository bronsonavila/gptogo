- Use `pnpm`.
- Avoid using abbreviations (e.g., say `error` or `event`, not `e`).
- Don't use the `any` type.
- Order all code elements alphabetically, unless there's a strongly compelling reason to do otherwise.
- Add newline gaps between components and logical blocks of code to allow for easier reading.
- Don't delete extra spaces that have already been added.
- Don't wait to be micromanaged; always apply your proposed changes.
